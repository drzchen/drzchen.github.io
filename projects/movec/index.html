Movec is an automated tool for runtime MOnitoring and VErification of C programs as an extension to the C programming language. Movec provides a source-to-source transformation that statically analyzes input C programs and generates instrumented C programs which can be compiled by any compliant C compiler such as GCC and other platform-specific compilers. By running the compiled programs, memory safety and the specified properties can be automatically monitored and verified at runtime. When a memory error is detected, an error message is reported automatically. The user may also specify customized runtime behavior for the specified properties, e.g., forcing the program to abort or executing a code snippet for recovery purposes. Movec can be used with fuzzy testing, like other dynamic analysis tools.
<p/>
<p>
In particular, Movec implements the following three features:
<ul>
<li> <B>Dynamic analysis of C memory safety.</B> Movec is different from other dynamic analysis tools primarily in two aspects. First, it uses a smart-status-based monitoring algorithm (cf. ISSTA'21, TOSEM'24), which is more effective in detecting memory errors than traditional approaches. Second, it uses a source-level instrumentation framework (cf. ISSTA'19, TSE'23), i.e., it directly rewrites the source code written by the programmer instead of the IR or binary code produced by a compiler, which makes Movec insensitive to compiler optimizations and platform-independent. </li>
<li> <B>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP).</B> Movec automatically weaves aspect (monitor) specifications written in the Aclang language (an aspect-oriented C programming language) into Movec-unaware C programs. The Aclang language can define pointcuts and advices concerning program's internal events such as calling/executing functions and getting/setting variable values (cf. OOPSLA'24). </li>
<li> <B>Monitoring-oriented programming (MOP).</B> Movec automatically weaves aspect (monitor) specifications (with properties and their handlers being specified) written in the Movec language (an extension of Aclang) into Movec-unaware C programs. The Movec language can define formal properties written in regular expressions, finite state machines and temporal logics (cf. TACAS'16). </li>
</ul>

    Movec version 0.9.0 for Ubuntu 64-bit</a> <br/>
    This package contains not only Movec, but also examples of using Movec for memory safety and AOP. Furthermore, it contains the SARD benchmark suite and the MSBench benchmark suite below (also called Memsafe in our papers), and the Nptrs benchmark suite.</li>

<p>
To run Movec, please put its executable file in a directory in your PATH. Note that:
<ul>
  <li>Movec is developed and tested under Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit. It may also work under other compatible Linux releases, but we cannot guarantee that.</li>
  <li>You can use "movec --version" to show its version, "movec -h" to show user instructions. But note that some of the listed options are not available in this version, and using them takes no effect.</li>
  <li>If you are not familiar with the user instructions and the syntax of Aclang and Movec (for writing aspects and monitors), please learn from the examples and benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
